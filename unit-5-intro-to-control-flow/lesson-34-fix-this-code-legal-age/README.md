# Fix this code: legal age

This is an example of poorly written code. The code **works fine**, but it's very ugly. Your job is to refactor it contains the minimum amount of lines (and if statements), while still being readable.

Keep an eye on the only test, and check out the `elif` statement, it might be useful ðŸ˜‰.
